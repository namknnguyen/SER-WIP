What I've currently done:
-Data preprocessing and feature extraction on IEMOCAP dataset

-Built a baseline Bidirectional LSTM Attention model for speech emotion recognition (SER)

-Tuned the model using Bayesian optimization 

-Baseline accuracy: 45-49%

Currently developing a CTRNN-based model to compare. Estimated finishing time: 1 week.
